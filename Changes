Revision history for Transmission-Client

       - Update types of Transmission::Torrent attributes

         With the stricter type coercions introduced with 0.08, types
         specified in the transmission rpc spec to be doubles were
         truncated to integers. This is now fixed.

       - Don't use the defined or operator (//). It's only available
         since perl 5.10.0. Fixes test failures.

       - Improvements in type coercions for numeric types

         Numeric types that got encoded in JSON as strings were
         silently ignored by Transmission. Now we make sure that
         they are converted to numeric types (SVp_IOK | SVp_NOK),
         regardless of input.
