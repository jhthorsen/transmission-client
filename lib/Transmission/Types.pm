Transmission::Types - Moose types for Transmission

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The types below is pretty much what you would expect them to be, execpt
for some (maybe weird?) default values - that is for coercion from "Any".

The type names correspond to types used in the Transmission RPC
specification.

=head2 number

# If Perl thinks a value is a string, JSON will encode it as such. But
# Transmission is picky about how parameters are encoded in the JSON
# request, so we make sure Perl knows how to store numeric types.
